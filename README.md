# Wordle-Solver
Automated Python program for playing the Wordle game, as well as the popular variants Dordle (2 words at the same time), Quordle (4), and Octordle (8)---and even the Sedecordle (16) mayhem. More generally, it supports Wordle variants with an arbitrary number of words, with the maximum allowed tries being 5 greater than the number of words. 
Using the starting word "SLATE", this solves the NYT one-word Wordle for 96.1% of the possible 5-letter solutions, with an average of ~3.9 guesses. 
As citation, this work makes use of the NYT Wordle list of 2309 five-letter words obtained from [], as well as calculated word frequencies across the Wikipedia corpus ascertained from []
