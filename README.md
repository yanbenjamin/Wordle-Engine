# Wordle Engine 
## Description
This Wordle engine is an automated Python program for playing the Wordle game. It is able to solve $96.1\%$ of the possible words in Wordle with an average of $\sim 3.9$ guesses. 
<br/>
It has been extended with reasonable accuracy to variants Dordle (2 words simultaneously in 7 tries), Quordle (4 words in 9 tries), and Octordle (8 words in 13 tries). More generally, it applies to any variant with $M$ words and $M+5$ word tries. Below are sample results of the engine on Wordle and Dordle, respectively. More quantitative results are shown below.

## Engine Implementation Details  


<!---
Automated Python program for playing the Wordle game, as well as the popular variants Dordle (2 words at the same time), Quordle (4), and Octordle (8)---and even the Sedecordle (16) mayhem. More generally, it supports Wordle variants with an arbitrary number of words, with the maximum allowed tries being 5 greater than the number of words. 
Using the starting word "SLATE", this solves the NYT one-word Wordle for 96.1% of the possible 5-letter solutions, with an average of ~3.9 guesses.
